Late in the night, they came to a huge bridge, or at least the rest of a once mighty bridge. It was small and seemed to be not very save.

So we have to hurry up. It will only hold two of us at the same time and it is a long bridge. The wounded knight will need 25 minutes to go over the bridge, and it will take me 20.

We will need your magic light wand to cross it. Without light we will fall down in the cold and deep water. So always someone has to return to bring back the wand of light to the others.\"\n \"What shall we do now?\" asked the paladin \"How can we all reach the other side before the evil orcs will get us? I have no arrow left and we cant fight them! In which order we have to pass the bridge?

Our order has never truly recovered from the losses in our war against Goshnar and his undead hordes. Now with the death of our leaders and best warriors in the attack of the demonic forces we don't stand a chance against our enemies. Our only hope is to gather new forces and retake the chamber of dreams. Of couse I know the right method to distract hugo long enough to get past him. The dreammaster is important to teach our recruits in the old ways and the art of dreamwalking. We need a leader for our cause and we need him bad. Headless we will fail and fall. It's already uncertain who took the nightmare chronicles out of the pits and I have no idea where they hid them. They are fighting about power and influence but unity is the key to success. Our whole order is centred about unity. All our rituals and procedures rooted on unity and sharing, they can't neglect it."}, -- a book
